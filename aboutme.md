Hi there! Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), Ethical Hacking, and Security Awareness.

In my spare time, I enhance my skills by participating in CTF platforms, competitions, and online courses. I also enjoy building computers and coding in Python.

For those unfamiliar, OSINT involves gathering information from publicly available sources to uncover valuable information. Through my blog posts, I aim to highlight techniques that hackers use to compromise digital security while also improving upon my own cybersecurity skill set.
